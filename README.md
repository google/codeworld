CodeWorld
=========

CodeWorld is an educational environment using Haskell.  It provides a simple
mathematical model for geometric figures, animations, and interactive and
multi-player games.  The web-based programming environment supports this
educational mission with a zero-setup editor and compiler, easy sharing and
cloud storage of projects, and the ability to run programs right in the web
browser using GHCJS.

There are several variants of CodeWorld available:

- [CodeWorld](https://code.world/) uses an educational variant of the Haskell
  language and libraries, designed to support mathematics instruction.
- [CodeWorld Haskell](https://code.world/haskell) is built against standard
  Haskell instead of the educational variant, to build programs which can either
  be on the web site with GHCJS, or compiled natively with the `codeworld-api`
  package and `blank-canvas`.
- [CodeWorld Blocks](https://code.world/blocks) provides a drag-and-drop
  programming user interface for younger students to build programs with
  CodeWorld.

Status
======

CodeWorld is stable and has been used in schools for years!  See [the users page](https://github.com/google/codeworld/blob/master/Users.md) for a partial list.
We're constantly improving the environment, though.  Breaking changes, when
necessary, are scheduled to occur between typical (U.S.) K-12 school
semesters, to minimize disruption of existing classes.

Google is distributing the code for CodeWorld, but CodeWorld is not an
official Google project, and Google provides no support for it.  Instead,
questions about the project or code should be asked to the
[codeworld-discuss mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!members/codeworld-discuss).
A student-friendly question and answer forum is also available at
http://help.code.world for questions about programs written *using* CodeWorld,
rather than questions about building or modifying CodeWorld itself.

Getting Started
===============

Just visit https://code.world to get started.

There is no need to download or install anything to use CodeWorld.  This
repository will be useful if you prefer to fork and modify the CodeWorld
environment, or contribute changes.

Discuss and Learn More
======================

To discuss and hear announcements about CodeWorld, subscribe to the mailing
list at https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/codeworld-discuss

The mailing list should be used to:
- Hear announcements about and discuss upcoming changes and features.
- Ask questions about using the system, and give feedback about your
  experiences.
- Share interesting ways of using the site, related classroom activities, and
  more.

Contributing
============

There is a slight bit of paperwork involved in contributing to CodeWorld.  You'll need to
agree to a Contributor License Agreement.  See CONTRIBUTING.md for details.

Build and Deployment
====================

Building and running CodeWorld can be a lengthy process, but is automated using the
installation scripts in the root directory, which work on most forms of Linux, including
Debian, Ubuntu, RedHat, and CentOS.  The step by step instructions are as follows:

0. Read the caveats, explained below.
1. Change to the root directory of the project.
2. Run `./install.sh` to set up the project.
3. Run `./run.sh` to start the server.

You can now access the CodeWorld system at http://localhost:8080.

If you make changes to CodeWorld, you can rebuild it without rebuilding the dependencies:

1. Change to the root directory of the project.
2. Run `./build.sh` to recompile just CodeWorld itself, using previously installed tools and libraries.
3. Run `./run.sh` to start the server.

Caveats
-------

### Leaky GHCJS Sandboxing ###

While the installation process installs most of its files inside `codeworld/build`, it does
clobber `~/.ghc`, `~/.ghcjs`, and `~/.cabal`.  I recommend that you run CodeWorld as a
dedicated user account to avoid causing problems for other Haskell installations.  If you
don't, note that you will lose your user package database.

See bug #4 for details.

### Google API Key ###

CodeWorld allows users to authenticate using a Google account, and save their
projects.  For this feature to work, you need to obtain a Google API key, and store
it in `web/clientId.txt`.  If you don't do this, the sign-in and save features will
not function correctly, but the rest of the site will be usable.

To get a Google API key for your CodeWorld installation, please consult the
following resources:

* [Creating a project](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects)
* [Creating an OAuth client ID](https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/6158849?hl=en)

Once you have a Google API key, copy and paste it into `web/clientId.txt`. A running
CodeWorld instance will immediately pick up changes to this file.

### Swap Space ###

If you are installing CodeWorld on a virtual server, be aware that the default
RAM on these servers is often not sufficient for GHC.  CodeWorld needs to compile very
large Haskell projects during its installation.  The following should be sufficient to
resolve any out-of-memory problems you encounter:

    $ sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/swap bs=1024 count=2097152
    $ sudo mkswap /swap
    $ sudo swapon /swap

This creates a 2 GB swap file to increase available virtual memory.  Installation with
a swap file may be slow, but it will succeed.  (Unless you intend to write very large
programs in CodeWorld, it's usually safe to remove the swap file after running the
server for the first time.)

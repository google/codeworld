{-| An event initiated by the user.

    Values of this type represent events that the user triggers when
    using an interaction, defined with 'interactionOf'.

    Key events describe the key as 'Text'.  Most keys are represented
    by a single character text string, with the capital letter or other
    symbol from the key.  Keys that don't correspond to a single
    character use longer names from the following list.  Keep in mind
    that not all of these keys appear on all keyboards.

    * Up, Down, Left, and Right for the cursor keys.
    * F1, F2, etc. for function keys.
    * Backspace
    * Tab
    * Enter
    * Shift
    * Ctrl
    * Alt
    * Esc
    * PageUp
    * PageDown
    * End
    * Home
    * Insert
    * Delete
    * CapsLock
    * NumLock
    * ScrollLock
    * PrintScreen
    * Break
    * Separator
    * Cancel

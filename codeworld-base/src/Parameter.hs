-- | A drawing that depends on parameters.  The first argument is a
-- list of parameters.  The second is a picture, which depends on the
-- values of those parameters.  Each number used to retrieve the picture
-- is the value of the corresponding parameter in the first list.

-- | Adjusts the output of a parameter by passing it through a conversion
-- function.  Built-in parameters usually range from 0 to 1, and conversions
-- can be used to rescale the output to a different range.
converted :: (Parameter, Number -> Number) -> Parameter
converted (p, c) = CW.converted (toDouble . c . fromDouble) p

-- | Changes the name of an existing parameter.
renamed :: (Parameter, Text) -> Parameter

-- | A 'Parameter' with a constant value, and no way to change it.
constant :: (Text, Number) -> Parameter
constant (name, n) = CW.constant (fromCWText name) (toDouble n)

-- | A 'Parameter' that can be toggled between 0 (off) and 1 (on).
toggle :: Text -> Parameter
toggle name = CW.toggle (fromCWText name)

-- | A 'Parameter' that counts how many times it has been clicked.
counter :: Text -> Parameter
counter name = CW.counter (fromCWText name)

-- | A 'Parameter' that can be adjusted continuously between 0 and 1.
slider :: Text -> Parameter
slider name = CW.slider (fromCWText name)

-- | A 'Parameter' that has a randomly chosen value.  It offers a button to
-- regenerate its value.
random :: Text -> Parameter
random name = CW.random (fromCWText name)

-- | A 'Parameter' that changes over time. It can be paused or reset.
timer :: Text -> Parameter
timer name = CW.timer (fromCWText name)

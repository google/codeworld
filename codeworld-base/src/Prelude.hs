-- $intro
-- Welome to CodeWorld!  You can define your own pictures, animations, and games
-- by defining variables and functions.  There are four kinds of CodeWorld
-- programs:
--
-- * Pictures.  To create a picture, you'll define the variable called @program@
--   using 'drawingOf'.  The parameter to 'drawingOf' should be a 'Picture'.
--   Example:
--
-- > program = drawingOf(tree)
--
-- * Animations.  To create an animation, you'll define the variable called
--   @program@ using 'animationOf'.  The parameter to 'animationOf' should be a
--   function, mapping each time in seconds (a 'Number') to a 'Picture' that is
--   shown at that time.  Example:
--
-- > program = animationOf(spinningWheel)
--
-- * Simulations.  A simulation is like an animation, in that it changes over
--   time.  But while an animation changes in a simple regular way over time, a
--   simulation can change in different ways depending on the state of things
--   at any moment.  To create a simulation, you should first decide on the
--   type to describe the state of things (called the "world" type), and
--   describe the simulation in terms of the starting state, the step that
--   says how things change over time, and and a draw function that can build
--   a picture from a state.  Then you'll use 'simulationOf' to define @program@.
--   Example:
--
-- > program = simulationOf(start, step, draw)
--
-- * Interactions.  Finally, you can build an interactive simulation, such as
--   a game.  This is very like a simulation, except that it also has an event
--   function, which says how the state of things changes when events (like
--   keys being pressed or the mouse moving) happen.  You'll use
--   'interactionOf' to define these.  Example:
--
-- > program = interactionOf(start, step, event, draw)

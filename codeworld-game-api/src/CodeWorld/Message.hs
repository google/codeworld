  Protocol:

  Create a new game with some number n of expected players, with a given signature.
  Join it automatically, and wait for other players.  Returns a player id and game id for
  the new game.

      -> NewGame <n> <sig>
      <- JoinedAs 0 <gid>

  OR join an existing game. Returns the player id and game id.  The server verifies the
  signature, and responds GameAborted if it doesn't match the signature from NewGame.

      -> JoinGame <gid> <sig>
      <- JoinedAs <i> <gid>

  Server tells the clients about the number of connected players and number of expected players

      <- PlayersWaiting <m> <n>

  Server tells the clients that the game has started

      <- Started

  Client sends an input event.  The server sends input event to all players, with a player id.

      -> InEvent <e>
      <- OutEvent <i> <e>

  Server indicates to the client that they have been disconnected. Closes the connection.

      <- GameAborted

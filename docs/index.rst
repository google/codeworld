Overview
========

Welcome to CodeWorld!  CodeWorld is an educational computer programming environment.
By using a simple mathematical model for geometric shapes and transformations, you
can create drawings, animations, and even single-player and multi-player video games!
The programming language used is a variation of Haskell_, but you can think of it as
just talking to the computer using mathematics.

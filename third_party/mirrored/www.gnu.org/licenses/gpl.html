          <h3><a name="preamble"></a>Preamble</h3>

          <p>
            The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
            software and other kinds of works.
          </p>

          <p>
            The licenses for most software and other practical works are
            designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By
            contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee
            your freedom to share and change all versions of a program--to make
            sure it remains free software for all its users. We, the Free
            Software Foundation, use the GNU General Public License for most of
            our software; it applies also to any other work released this way by
            its authors. You can apply it to your programs, too.
          </p>

          <p>
            When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
            price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
            you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and
            charge for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can
            get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use
            pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do
            these things.
          </p>

          <p>
            To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
            these rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you
            have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the
            software, or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the
            freedom of others.
          </p>

          <p>
            For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
            gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
            freedoms that you received. You must make sure that they, too,
            receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these
            terms so they know their rights.
          </p>

          <p>
            Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
            (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
            giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.
          </p>

          <p>
            For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly
            explains that there is no warranty for this free software. For both
            users' and authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be
            marked as changed, so that their problems will not be attributed
            erroneously to authors of previous versions.
          </p>

          <p>
            Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
            modified versions of the software inside them, although the
            manufacturer can do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the
            aim of protecting users' freedom to change the software. The
            systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for
            individuals to use, which is precisely where it is most
            unacceptable. Therefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to
            prohibit the practice for those products. If such problems arise
            substantially in other domains, we stand ready to extend this
            provision to those domains in future versions of the GPL, as needed
            to protect the freedom of users.
          </p>

          <p>
            Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
            States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
            software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish
            to avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program
            could make it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL
            assures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.
          </p>

          <p>
            The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
            modification follow.
          </p>

          <h3><a name="terms"></a>TERMS AND CONDITIONS</h3>

          <h4><a name="section0"></a>0. Definitions.</h4>

          <p>
            &ldquo;This License&rdquo; refers to version 3 of the GNU General
            Public License.
          </p>

          <p>
            &ldquo;Copyright&rdquo; also means copyright-like laws that apply to
            other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks.
          </p>

          <p>
            &ldquo;The Program&rdquo; refers to any copyrightable work licensed
            under this License. Each licensee is addressed as &ldquo;you&rdquo;.
            &ldquo;Licensees&rdquo; and &ldquo;recipients&rdquo; may be
            individuals or organizations.
          </p>

          <p>
            To &ldquo;modify&rdquo; a work means to copy from or adapt all or
            part of the work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other
            than the making of an exact copy. The resulting work is called a
            &ldquo;modified version&rdquo; of the earlier work or a work
            &ldquo;based on&rdquo; the earlier work.
          </p>

          <p>
            A &ldquo;covered work&rdquo; means either the unmodified Program or
            a work based on the Program.
          </p>

          <p>
            To &ldquo;propagate&rdquo; a work means to do anything with it that,
            without permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable
            for infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it
            on a computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes
            copying, distribution (with or without modification), making
            available to the public, and in some countries other activities as
            well.
          </p>

          <p>
            To &ldquo;convey&rdquo; a work means any kind of propagation that
            enables other parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction
            with a user through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy,
            is not conveying.
          </p>

          <p>
            An interactive user interface displays &ldquo;Appropriate Legal
            Notices&rdquo; to the extent that it includes a convenient and
            prominently visible feature that (1) displays an appropriate
            copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that there is no warranty
            for the work (except to the extent that warranties are provided),
            that licensees may convey the work under this License, and how to
            view a copy of this License. If the interface presents a list of
            user commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the
            list meets this criterion.
          </p>

          <h4><a name="section1"></a>1. Source Code.</h4>

          <p>
            The &ldquo;source code&rdquo; for a work means the preferred form of
            the work for making modifications to it. &ldquo;Object code&rdquo;
            means any non-source form of a work.
          </p>

          <p>
            A &ldquo;Standard Interface&rdquo; means an interface that either is
            an official standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in
            the case of interfaces specified for a particular programming
            language, one that is widely used among developers working in that
            language.
          </p>

          <p>
            The &ldquo;System Libraries&rdquo; of an executable work include
            anything, other than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in
            the normal form of packaging a Major Component, but which is not
            part of that Major Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of
            the work with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard
            Interface for which an implementation is available to the public in
            source code form. A &ldquo;Major Component&rdquo;, in this context,
            means a major essential component (kernel, window system, and so on)
            of the specific operating system (if any) on which the executable
            work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an object code
            interpreter used to run it.
          </p>

          <p>
            The &ldquo;Corresponding Source&rdquo; for a work in object code
            form means all the source code needed to generate, install, and (for
            an executable work) run the object code and to modify the work,
            including scripts to control those activities. However, it does not
            include the work's System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or
            generally available free programs which are used unmodified in
            performing those activities but which are not part of the work. For
            example, Corresponding Source includes interface definition files
            associated with source files for the work, and the source code for
            shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is
            specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data
            communication or control flow between those subprograms and other
            parts of the work.
          </p>

          <p>
            The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can
            regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
            Source.
          </p>

          <p>
            The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same
            work.
          </p>

          <h4><a name="section2"></a>2. Basic Permissions.</h4>

          <p>
            All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
            copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
            conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
            permission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a
            covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given
            its content, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges
            your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by
            copyright law.
          </p>

          <p>
            You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
            convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains
            in force. You may convey covered works to others for the sole
            purpose of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or
            provide you with facilities for running those works, provided that
            you comply with the terms of this License in conveying all material
            for which you do not control copyright. Those thus making or running
            the covered works for you must do so exclusively on your behalf,
            under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit them from
            making any copies of your copyrighted material outside their
            relationship with you.
          </p>

          <p>
            Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
            the conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10
            makes it unnecessary.
          </p>

          <h4>
            <a name="section3"></a>3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From
            Anti-Circumvention Law.
          </h4>

          <p>
            No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
            measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under
            article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996,
            or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
            measures.
          </p>

          <p>
            When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
            circumvention of technological measures to the extent such
            circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License
            with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to
            limit operation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing,
            against the work's users, your or third parties' legal rights to
            forbid circumvention of technological measures.
          </p>

          <h4><a name="section4"></a>4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.</h4>

          <p>
            You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
            receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
            appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
            keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
            non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the
            code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and
            give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.
          </p>

          <p>
            You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
            and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.
          </p>

          <h4><a name="section5"></a>5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.</h4>

          <p>
            You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
            produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
            terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these
            conditions:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
              it, and giving a relevant date.
            </li>

            <li>
              b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
              released under this License and any conditions added under section
              7. This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to
              &ldquo;keep intact all notices&rdquo;.
            </li>

            <li>
              c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
              License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This
              License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
              additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
              regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no
              permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
              invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.
            </li>

            <li>
              d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
              Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
              interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your
              work need not make them do so.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
            works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
            and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
            in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
            &ldquo;aggregate&rdquo; if the compilation and its resulting
            copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the
            compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit.
            Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not cause this
            License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate.
          </p>

          <h4><a name="section6"></a>6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.</h4>

          <p>
            You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of
            sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable
            Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of
            these ways:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
              (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
              Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
              customarily used for software interchange.
            </li>

            <li>
              b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
              (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
              written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
              long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product
              model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a
              copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the
              product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical
              medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no
              more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this
              conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the Corresponding
              Source from a network server at no charge.
            </li>

            <li>
              c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
              written offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This
              alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and
              only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord
              with subsection 6b.
            </li>

            <li>
              d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
              place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
              Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
              further charge. You need not require recipients to copy the
              Corresponding Source along with the object code. If the place to
              copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source
              may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)
              that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain
              clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
              Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the
              Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is
              available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.
            </li>

            <li>
              e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission,
              provided you inform other peers where the object code and
              Corresponding Source of the work are being offered to the general
              public at no charge under subsection 6d.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is
            excluded from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not
            be included in conveying the object code work.
          </p>

          <p>
            A &ldquo;User Product&rdquo; is either (1) a &ldquo;consumer
            product&rdquo;, which means any tangible personal property which is
            normally used for personal, family, or household purposes, or (2)
            anything designed or sold for incorporation into a dwelling. In
            determining whether a product is a consumer product, doubtful cases
            shall be resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular product
            received by a particular user, &ldquo;normally used&rdquo; refers to
            a typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the
            status of the particular user or of the way in which the particular
            user actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product. A
            product is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has
            substantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such
            uses represent the only significant mode of use of the product.
          </p>

          <p>
            &ldquo;Installation Information&rdquo; for a User Product means any
            methods, procedures, authorization keys, or other information
            required to install and execute modified versions of a covered work
            in that User Product from a modified version of its Corresponding
            Source. The information must suffice to ensure that the continued
            functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented or
            interfered with solely because modification has been made.
          </p>

          <p>
            If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
            specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as
            part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of
            the User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or
            for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is
            characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under this section
            must be accompanied by the Installation Information. But this
            requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party
            retains the ability to install modified object code on the User
            Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM).
          </p>

          <p>
            The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include
            a requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or
            updates for a work that has been modified or installed by the
            recipient, or for the User Product in which it has been modified or
            installed. Access to a network may be denied when the modification
            itself materially and adversely affects the operation of the network
            or violates the rules and protocols for communication across the
            network.
          </p>

          <p>
            Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information
            provided, in accord with this section must be in a format that is
            publicly documented (and with an implementation available to the
            public in source code form), and must require no special password or
            key for unpacking, reading or copying.
          </p>

          <h4><a name="section7"></a>7. Additional Terms.</h4>

          <p>
            &ldquo;Additional permissions&rdquo; are terms that supplement the
            terms of this License by making exceptions from one or more of its
            conditions. Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire
            Program shall be treated as though they were included in this
            License, to the extent that they are valid under applicable law. If
            additional permissions apply only to part of the Program, that part
            may be used separately under those permissions, but the entire
            Program remains governed by this License without regard to the
            additional permissions.
          </p>

          <p>
            When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
            remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part
            of it. (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
            removal in certain cases when you modify the work.) You may place
            additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
            for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.
          </p>

          <p>
            Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material
            you add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright
            holders of that material) supplement the terms of this License with
            terms:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the
              terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or
            </li>

            <li>
              b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or
              author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal
              Notices displayed by works containing it; or
            </li>

            <li>
              c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material,
              or requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
              reasonable ways as different from the original version; or
            </li>

            <li>
              d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors
              or authors of the material; or
            </li>

            <li>
              e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
              trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or
            </li>

            <li>
              f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
              material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions
              of it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient,
              for any liability that these contractual assumptions directly
              impose on those licensors and authors.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            All other non-permissive additional terms are considered
            &ldquo;further restrictions&rdquo; within the meaning of section 10.
            If the Program as you received it, or any part of it, contains a
            notice stating that it is governed by this License along with a term
            that is a further restriction, you may remove that term. If a
            license document contains a further restriction but permits
            relicensing or conveying under this License, you may add to a
            covered work material governed by the terms of that license
            document, provided that the further restriction does not survive
            such relicensing or conveying.
          </p>

          <p>
            If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
            must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
            additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
            where to find the applicable terms.
          </p>

          <p>
            Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the
            form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the
            above requirements apply either way.
          </p>

          <h4><a name="section8"></a>8. Termination.</h4>

          <p>
            You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
            provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
            modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights
            under this License (including any patent licenses granted under the
            third paragraph of section 11).
          </p>

          <p>
            However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
            license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
            provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
            finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the
            copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some
            reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.
          </p>

          <p>
            Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
            reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
            violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
            received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from
            that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days
            after your receipt of the notice.
          </p>

          <p>
            Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
            licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you
            under this License. If your rights have been terminated and not
            permanently reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses
            for the same material under section 10.
          </p>

          <h4>
            <a name="section9"></a>9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.
          </h4>

          <p>
            You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
            run a copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work
            occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
            to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However,
            nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate
            or modify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you
            do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
            covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.
          </p>

          <h4>
            <a name="section10"></a>10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream
            Recipients.
          </h4>

          <p>
            Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
            receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
            propagate that work, subject to this License. You are not
            responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this
            License.
          </p>

          <p>
            An &ldquo;entity transaction&rdquo; is a transaction transferring
            control of an organization, or substantially all assets of one, or
            subdividing an organization, or merging organizations. If
            propagation of a covered work results from an entity transaction,
            each party to that transaction who receives a copy of the work also
            receives whatever licenses to the work the party's predecessor in
            interest had or could give under the previous paragraph, plus a
            right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the work from the
            predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it
            with reasonable efforts.
          </p>

          <p>
            You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
            rights granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may
            not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of
            rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate
            litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit)
            alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making, using,
            selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or any portion
            of it.
          </p>

          <h4><a name="section11"></a>11. Patents.</h4>

          <p>
            A &ldquo;contributor&rdquo; is a copyright holder who authorizes use
            under this License of the Program or a work on which the Program is
            based. The work thus licensed is called the contributor's
            &ldquo;contributor version&rdquo;.
          </p>

          <p>
            A contributor's &ldquo;essential patent claims&rdquo; are all patent
            claims owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already
            acquired or hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some
            manner, permitted by this License, of making, using, or selling its
            contributor version, but do not include claims that would be
            infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the
            contributor version. For purposes of this definition,
            &ldquo;control&rdquo; includes the right to grant patent sublicenses
            in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License.
          </p>

          <p>
            Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
            patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to
            make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify
            and propagate the contents of its contributor version.
          </p>

          <p>
            In the following three paragraphs, a &ldquo;patent license&rdquo; is
            any express agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to
            enforce a patent (such as an express permission to practice a patent
            or covenant not to sue for patent infringement). To
            &ldquo;grant&rdquo; such a patent license to a party means to make
            such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the
            party.
          </p>

          <p>
            If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
            and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
            to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through
            a publicly available network server or other readily accessible
            means, then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be
            so available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of
            the patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a
            manner consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend
            the patent license to downstream recipients. &ldquo;Knowingly
            relying&rdquo; means you have actual knowledge that, but for the
            patent license, your conveying the covered work in a country, or
            your recipient's use of the covered work in a country, would
            infringe one or more identifiable patents in that country that you
            have reason to believe are valid.
          </p>

          <p>
            If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
            arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
            covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
            receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate,
            modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the
            patent license you grant is automatically extended to all recipients
            of the covered work and works based on it.
          </p>

          <p>
            A patent license is &ldquo;discriminatory&rdquo; if it does not
            include within the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of,
            or is conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights
            that are specifically granted under this License. You may not convey
            a covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third
            party that is in the business of distributing software, under which
            you make payment to the third party based on the extent of your
            activity of conveying the work, and under which the third party
            grants, to any of the parties who would receive the covered work
            from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in connection with
            copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from
            those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with specific
            products or compilations that contain the covered work, unless you
            entered into that arrangement, or that patent license was granted,
            prior to 28 March 2007.
          </p>

          <p>
            Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
            any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
            otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.
          </p>

          <h4><a name="section12"></a>12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.</h4>

          <p>
            If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement
            or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they
            do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot
            convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your
            obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations,
            then as a consequence you may not convey it at all. For example, if
            you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for
            further conveying from those to whom you convey the Program, the
            only way you could satisfy both those terms and this License would
            be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.

            <a name="section13"></a>13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public
            License.
          </h4>

          <p>
            Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
            permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
            under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a
            single combined work, and to convey the resulting work. The terms of
            this License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered
            work, but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public
            License, section 13, concerning interaction through a network will
            apply to the combination as such.
          </p>

          <h4><a name="section14"></a>14. Revised Versions of this License.</h4>

          <p>
            The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
            of the GNU General Public License from time to time. Such new
            versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
            differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
          </p>

          <p>
            Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the
            Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General
            Public License &ldquo;or any later version&rdquo; applies to it, you
            have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that
            numbered version or of any later version published by the Free
            Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version
            number of the GNU General Public License, you may choose any version
            ever published by the Free Software Foundation.
          </p>

          <p>
            If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
            versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's
            public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes
            you to choose that version for the Program.
          </p>

          <p>
            Later license versions may give you additional or different
            permissions. However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
            author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
            later version.
          </p>

          <h4><a name="section15"></a>15. Disclaimer of Warranty.</h4>

          <p>
            THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
            APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE
            COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &ldquo;AS
            IS&rdquo; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,

            MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE
            RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.
            SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL
            NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

            If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
            above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
            reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely
            approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection
            with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability
            accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee.

          <h3>
            <a name="howto"></a>How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
          </h3>

          <p>
            If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
            possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make
            it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under
            these terms.
          </p>

          <p>
            To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest
            to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
            state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
            the &ldquo;copyright&rdquo; line and a pointer to where the full
            notice is found.
          </p>

          <pre>
    &lt;one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;

            mail.
          </p>

          <p>
            If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short
            notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:
          </p>

          <p>
            The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the
            appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, your
            program's commands might be different; for a GUI interface, you
            would use an &ldquo;about box&rdquo;.
          </p>

          <p>
            You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or
            school, if any, to sign a &ldquo;copyright disclaimer&rdquo; for the
            program, if necessary. For more information on this, and how to

            The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your
            program into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine
            library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking
            proprietary applications with the library. If this is what you want
            to do, use the GNU Lesser General Public License instead of this

Welcome to CodeWorld!
=====================

CodeWorld is an environment where you can build create drawings, animations, and even
single-player and multi-player video games using mathematics, using shapes, colors and
transformations.  It's programming a computer with mathematics.

This is the *CodeWorld Guide*, to help get you started.  The guide is organized into parts,
which you can choose on the left.  Click *outside* the guide to start working.  But
don't worry: the **Guide** button at the bottom of the screen will get you back here.

How to be successful
====================

Before you get started, let's talk about some strategies to be successful.  Expand the
sections below to explore each strategy.

!!! collapsible: Try everything!
    You can't learn computer programming by reading about it. When you *wonder* what
    will happen if you try something, just try it. If you think you understand, prove
    it to yourself. You learn when you are writing code.

    Many of the examples in this guide can be copied into the CodeWorld editor and run as
    is! If you see a blue shaded code example, that means you can click on it to copy
    and run it, and see the result.

!!! collapsible: Value your mistakes!
    You might have heard that mistakes prove you are learning. That's even more true in
    computer programming. In fact, even the best programmers don't usually get it right
    the first time.  Writing code is only one step in computer programming. The next step
    is to try it, and fix your mistakes.

    A mistake doesn't mean you're bad at programming.  It just means you're not done
    yet. As you become a better programmer, you will still make mistakes, but you will
    learn to understand and fix your mistakes more easily.

!!! collapsible: Be creative!
    Although it's a good starting point to try the examples in this guide, it's not good
    enough.  To really understand coding, you need to write your own code, from the
    beginning, to build interesting things no one has built before.  So find things that
    inspire you, and set your own goals.  You learn the most when you start projects
    that you don't quite know how to finish, but strive to finish them anyway.

!!! collapsible: Expect to understand!
    Remember that your goal is never to get the right answer.  Your goal is to
    understand, so that you can build on your knowledge to do bigger and better things.
    If you don't understand, speak up! Ask questions, and dig deeper until you do.
    Never be happy with copying code but not understanding why it works.

!!! collapsible: Have fun!
    Coding can be difficult, because it requires you to think about all of the details,
    and say precisely what you mean. But it doesn't have to be unpleasant. Practice
    laughing at your experiences. Experienced coders all know the feeling of wanting to
    kick their computer across the room, but they can also talk about it with a grin.
    Share your creations with friends and family, whether or not they turned out exactly
    like you hoped.  Remember that we're all in this together, and we're on each other's
    side.

    To get some cool ideas about what you can do in CodeWorld, you might want to check
    out the [CodeWorld Gallery](/gallery.html), with examples of projects built by
    other students.  Don't worry if you aren't that advanced yet.  It takes patience,
    but you can get there, too.

The CodeWorld environment
=========================

Before you start writing your own code, here's a quick tour of the tools you have.

You'll type your code in the **editor**, which is right behind this guide.  To get
to the editor, click *outside* of the guide to get rid of it.  Don't worry; the
guide is right here waiting for you by pressing the **Guide** button.

It's important to save your work.  To do that, click the **Sign In** button.  Once
you're signed in, you will see the **project browser** on the left.  Use it to save
your projects, and load any projects you've saved earlier.

!!! Warning: Save your work!
    It's easy to work hard on a project, but forget to save it.  You could lose all
    that work!  Get in the habit of saving your program often.

To try your programs, click the **Run** button, at the bottom right corner of the
screen.  Your program will run in the **canvas**, at the top-right corner of the
screen.  Don't worry! Nothing you do in CodeWorld can harm your computer.

Beneath the canvas, the **message area** will show you any messages about
your program.  These could be *errors*, explaining what your computer doesn't
understand about your code.  They could be *warnings*, making a suggestion for
improving your code.  Or they could be *trace* messaged, that you can add
yourself to help understand what your program is doing.

If there's a problem with your code, the message window will turn a light red,
or pink, color.  This is called an *error message*.  It's okay!  Just read the
error message to understand what is wrong, and then double-check your code.
Remember: error messages are your friends; they help you fix mistakes.

Welcome to CodeWorld!
=====================
CodeWorld is an educational computer programming environment.
By using a simple mathematical model for geometric shapes and transformations, you
can create drawings, animations, and even single-player and multi-player video games!
The programming language used is a variant of [Haskell](http://haskell.org), but
you can think of it as just talking to the computer using mathematics.

This is the CodeWorld Guide, which will help get you started.  Click outside the guide
to start programming.  The *Guide* button at the bottom of the screen will get you
back here.  The outline to the left will allow you to jump between sections of this guide.

Overview
========

If you're in a middle school class taking a course using Codeworld, this guide should
follow the same path as your class.  That means you should be able to jump between sections
of the guide for reference when you need help with assignments.

You don't have to take a class in school to study Codeworld, though.  If you're learning on your
own, working through the parts of this guide in order should be a good way to build your skills
over time.  By the end of the last part of this guide, you'll be able to make all sorts of programs
using Codeworld.

To get an idea what you can do in CodeWorld, you might want to check out the
[CodeWorld Gallery](/gallery.html), with examples of projects built by students.

Tips for using this guide
-------------------------

* This guide works best if you try things; it won't do much good to just read. If you
  feel the urge to play around with something, please do! You can always come back after.
* Many of the examples in this guide can be copied into the CodeWorld editor and run as
  is! If you see a blue box, you can click it to copy the code and try it out.
* Try to write programs from the start, instead of copying and editing.  You'll
  be surprised how much it helps to think through the entire code every time.

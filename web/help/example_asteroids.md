Asteroids
=========

About the example
-----------------

Asteroids is an example of an elaborate game built with CodeWorld.  Using the
interaction mode, Asteroids keeps track of a detailed world state, and
simulates simple physics (vector acceleration and velocity) over time, as
well as responding to the user.  It tracks scores between games, and it uses
random numbers to make each game unique.  There's quite a lot there!

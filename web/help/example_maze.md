Maze
====

About the example
-----------------

This example generates random mazes, and allows the player to navigate
through the maze.  It is an example of a different style of game, using
interaction mode.  Unlike the Asteroids example, this game doesn't use
the step function at all!  Instead, all changes in the state are made
in response to actions from the user.

The program
-----------

    main = interactionOf(createWorld, firstOfPair, event, drawWorld)

    {- A World contains
        * the location of the player in the maze
        * the maze itself, which is a Maze
    -}
    data World = World { loc :: Point, maze :: Maze }

    {- Create the initial maze, using the random number supply -}
    createWorld :: RandomNumbers -> World
    createWorld(rs) = World { loc = (0, 0), maze = buildMaze(20, 20, rs) }

    {- Event handling: Move the player in the maze. -}
    event(w, KeyPress "Up")    = move(up,    w)
    event(w, KeyPress "Down")  = move(down,  w)
    event(w, KeyPress "Left")  = move(left,  w)
    event(w, KeyPress "Right") = move(right, w)
    event(w, _) = w

    move :: (Direction, World) -> World
    move(d, w@(World p@(x, y) (Maze _ _ _ ds))) =
      w { loc = if (containsDoor(ds, (p, p'))) then p' else p }
      where p' = addDirToPoint(p, d)

    {- Draw the maze and the player in it. -}
    drawWorld :: World -> Picture
    drawWorld w = scaled(translated(
        drawBall(loc(w)) & drawMaze(maze(w)), -10, -10), 0.98, 0.98)

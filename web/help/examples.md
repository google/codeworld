Example: Mandelbrot Set
=======================

This example draws a fractal known as the Mandelbrot set.  It is an advanced
example of pictures.  The main language features used are custom operators
and data types (for the complex numbers), and a crude way of drawing
bitmapped pictures.  The drawing is slow, but it works!

The example starts by teaching CodeWorld how to do arithmetic with complex
numbers.  The new operators `<+>` and `<*>` are chosen to represent complex
addition and multiplication.

~~~~~ . clickable
-- Complex arithmetic
data Complex where
    C :: (Number, Number) -> Complex

C(x1, y1) <+> C(x2, y2) = C(x1    + x2   , y1    + y2   )
C(x1, y1) <*> C(x2, y2) = C(x1*x2 - y1*y2, x1*y2 + y1*x2)

-- A depth can be a finite number, or infinite.
data Depth where
  Finite   :: Number -> Depth
  Infinite :: Depth

{-
    A point belongs to the Mandelbrot set if iterating the polynomial
    z -> z^2 + c, starting with z = 0, diverges.  As a quick test for
    divergence, we check whether either coordinate exceeds 2.

    To get a better image, for points that do not belong to the set, we
    measure how many iterations were needed to detect divergence.  This
    number will be large for points close to the set.  Returns Infinite for
    points in the set, and Finite k for points that leave the target box in
    k iterations.
-}
depth :: (Number, Complex, Complex, Number) -> Depth
depth(_, _, _, 0) = Infinite
depth(m, z, c, k) | diverged(z) = Finite(m)
                  | otherwise   = depth(m + 1, z <*> z <+> c, c, k - 1)
  where diverged :: Complex -> Truth
        diverged(C(x, y)) = abs(x) > 2 || abs(y) > 2

{-
    Finally, render the set on a 500 by 500 pixel grid.  The source
    area is the intervals [-2, 2] on the real and imaginary axes.
    A bit of simple math maps that to the screen.
-}

mandelbrot(n, k) = rotated(scaled(pic, 5, 5), 90)

Example: Bounce
===============

In this example, a ball bounces around the screen.  The ball starts with
a random position and velocity, and bounces when it hits the edge of the
screen.

This is an example of a program with state, using the `activityOf`
function.  The position of the ball would be difficult to describe in an
animation, as a function of the current time.  So instead, the program
simulates the movement of the ball in small steps, remembering what has
happened so far.

~~~~~ . clickable
program = activityOf(initial, fine(change, 0.05), picture)

    Ball :: (Point, Vector) -> World

radius = 2
border = 10 - radius
gravity = 30

                            (16*vx - 8, 16*vy - 8))

fine :: ((a, Event) -> a, Number) -> ((a, Event) -> a)
fine(f, max_dt) = ff
  where ff(x, TimePassing(dt))
          | dt > max_dt = ff(f(x, TimePassing(max_dt)), TimePassing(dt - max_dt))
        ff(x, other) = f(x, other)

change(world, TimePassing(dt)) = bounce(move(world, dt))
change(world, other)           = world

move(Ball((x,y), (vx,vy)), dt) = Ball((new_x, new_y), (new_vx, new_vy))
  where new_x  = x + vx * dt
        new_y  = y + vy * dt - 0.5 * gravity * dt ^ 2
        new_vx = vx
        new_vy = vy - gravity * dt

bounce(Ball((x,y), (vx,vy))) = Ball((x,y), (nvx, nvy))
  where nvx = if (x < -border && vx < 0) || (x > border && vx > 0) then -vx else vx
        nvy = if (y < -border && vy < 0) || (y > border && vy > 0) then -vy else vy

through the maze using their keyboard.  This demonstrates more of the

of events.

Example: Asteroids
==================

Asteroids is an example of an elaborate game built with CodeWorld.  It
combines interaction with the user through mouse and keyboard events, and
physics simulation with velocity and position vectors that runs
continuously over time.  The detailed game state also tracks scores
between games, and uses random numbers to make each game unique.  There's
quite a lot there!

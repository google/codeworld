Did you mean to reference a butterfly but not draw one?
I understand your point. Just wondering if the student might be
expecting a butterfly? Probably not if they understand polyline
at this point but just making sure.

 A neat trick is to use the coordinate plane as you write your code. Say you want to draw a butterfly. You might start by writing:

program   = drawingOf(butterfly & coordinatePlane)
butterfly = polyline([ ])
